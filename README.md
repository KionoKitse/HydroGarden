When it comes to hydroponics there are quite a few different types of systems to use. I particularly like the NFT method because it seems to be pretty simple and efficient. Also I like the idea of cascading water through a bunch of mini waterfalls. Anyway thats not what this is about. For this project I actually decided on the vertical tower method, which I guess could be argued that it's technically a NFT method anyway.

I came to this decision based on a couple of factors. The first and most important factor is that I wouldn't be readily available if something when amiss. Worse case scenario the roots clog some outlet and we have flooding that goes down to the neighbor's house. Next major issue is some sort of short and I take down the electricity for the entire complex (I'm thinking unlikely). Other than that were looking at plants dieing due to electrical issues or just plain stupidity (expected). Based on my fear of the first scenario I've decided that whatever I do, it needs to be a sealed system. No place for water to get out unexpectedly. Safest bet in that case would probably be kratky or DWC. Another way to combat the issue of an unexpected spill would be to just install this system inside the bathtub. Yes that is right I am sacrificing my bathtub to plants. I'd say that my bathtub is on the average to small size. Since I don't have much space to work with I'm thinking vertical instead of the kratky or DWC methods. There are a lot of vertical tower models to go on but eventually I decided on this one.

The reason being that it's super simple. It won't cost much up front to get started just some pipes, buckets and pumps. Normally I wouldn't like the idea of having an individual pump for each system but I think it might make some sense in my situation. Having each system self contained will cut down on the potential error points. It will also allow me to start small like one tower instead of multiple. Additionally having a bunch of small(ish) systems instead of one large system allows me to move stuff if I ever want to take a bath or make use of natural lighting. Who knows maybe it will work so well that I can move it into the bedroom or something.
